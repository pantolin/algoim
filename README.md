# Algoim
### Algorithms for implicitly defined geometry, level set methods, and Voronoi implicit interface methods.

This is a fork of the original Algoim's repository.
For a description of the original version, examples, and install instructions, see the [Algoim GitHub page](https://algoim.github.io/).

This fork includes some new features respect to the original version, namely:
* New functionalities for creating non-conforming high-order reparameterizations of implicit domains both for general smooth function and one or several Bernstein polynomials. It also supports reparameterization of the levelset manifold and the domain's *wirebasket*.
* VTK exporting capabilities for reparameterizations.
* Support for Bspline functions and functions defined in Cartesian grids (both for quadrature and reparameterization).
* Implementation of SVD and generalized eigenvalue functions for computing polynomials roots as alternative to LAPACK.
* Library of gyroid functions.
